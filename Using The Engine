#How to use the engine:


Key points to keep in mind while using our chess program:

To begin a game, type: ./chess

new </player1>(one of: computer1/computer2/computer3/human) </player2>(one of: computer1/computer2/computer3/human)
</setup <type>> (type can be: default or manually place all pieces according to assignment rubric)
For example:
new computer3 computer2 setup default
will start a new game with a default setup with white player as AI level3 and the black player as AI Level2

To move, use:
mv pos1 pos2 Â  for example: mv e2 pos2 ...

If at any point in the game you need to view the Game Analyzer, type in: 'analyze'

After every move, the program will show a list of all the black and white pieces on the board and the bin which contains 
all the pieces that have been captured/deleted and are no longer part of the game.

To undo a move at any state in the game, simply type in: "undo".

Also, if it is a human v/s AI or AI v/s AI game, at each step, information will be printed to the terminal screen 
about which player is playing. (white AI or black AI)
